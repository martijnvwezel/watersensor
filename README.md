Current, quick way is to place the file (my_custom_component.h) in the folder esphome, /config/esphome/my_custom_component.h (use vscode or file-editor in home assist by using an addon)

I assume you installed esphome using the home-assist addons
Create in esphome a new device and past the watermeter.yaml in it
press install button..


I am working on a clean install and using github link version, I am just not that far, sorry
