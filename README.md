Current, quick way is to place the file (my_custom_component.h) in the folder esphome, /config/esphome/my_custom_component.h (use vscode or file-editor in home assist by using an addon)

I assume you installed esphome using the home-assist addons
Select (ESP32-C3)
Create in esphome a new device and past the watermeter.yaml in it. replace esphome and esp32 section too.
press install button..
when you install you have to short 2 pins, yes the first version has an issue with boot-pin so short the 2 pins near USB-c port near the push buttons most right (download button pin and most right is the gnd)




I am working on a clean install and using github link version, I am just not that far, sorry
